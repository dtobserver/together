# Migration from Astro to Deno + React - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Successfully migrated the SyncWatch project from Astro SSG framework to a pure **Deno + React SPA** setup.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Project Structure

-   **Removed**: Astro configuration and dependencies
-   **Added**: New `frontend/` directory for React components
-   **Moved**: CSS and components to React-based structure

### 2. Frontend (React SPA)

-   **Framework**: Pure React 18 with React Router for client-side routing
-   **Build System**: esbuild for bundling and development
-   **Styling**: TailwindCSS via CDN (same as before)
-   **State Management**: Zustand (ready for future use)

### 3. Backend (Deno Server)

-   **Unchanged**: Deno server with Oak framework
-   **Enhanced**: Now serves the React build from `/dist` directory
-   **Fixed**: Middleware order to ensure API routes work correctly

### 4. Build Process

-   **Development**: `deno task dev` - builds React in watch mode
-   **Production**: `deno task build` - builds optimized React bundle
-   **Server**: `deno task server:start` - serves the React app + API

```

## Key Features Preserved

-   ✅ **Room Creation**: Create new rooms with custom names
-   ✅ **Room Joining**: Join existing rooms by ID
-   ✅ **User Management**: Username handling and persistence
-   ✅ **API Integration**: All existing API endpoints functional
-   ✅ **Real-time Features**: Long-polling system ready
-   ✅ **Responsive Design**: TailwindCSS styling maintained

## How to Use

### Development Mode

```bash
# Build React frontend and start server
deno task build
deno task server:start

# Or run frontend in watch mode (in separate terminal)
deno task dev  # for frontend watch mode
deno task server:dev  # for backend watch mode
```

### Production Mode

```bash
deno task build
deno task server:start
```

### Access the Application

-   **Frontend**: http://localhost:8061
-   **API Health**: http://localhost:8061/health
-   **API Base**: http://localhost:8061/api

## Migration Benefits

1. **No SSR Overhead**: Faster, simpler deployment as SPA
2. **Better React Integration**: Native React development experience
3. **Simplified Build**: Single bundling process with esbuild
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features preserved
5. **Modern Stack**: Latest React with TypeScript support

## Next Steps

The migration is complete and functional. Future enhancements can include:

-   Enhanced room functionality (video sync, chat)
-   State management with Zustand
-   Progressive Web App features
-   Enhanced error handling and loading states
